**The toolbox for engineers to enhance privacy in P2P networks**

p3lib implements a set of privacy preserving primitives (p3) and protocols for
routing and messaging in P2P networks. It's basically plug-and-play privacy for
your decentralized and distributed systems.

The primitives implemented by p3lib are based on privacy enhancing tech
research. As an example, `p3lib-sphinx` implements a general-purpose onion routing packet
construction and processor based on Sphinx [1]. p3lib aims at adding more primitives and
protocols in the future. Stay tuned and [let us know what you'd like to see as part of p3lib](https://github.com/hashmatter/p3lib/issues/18)
library.

| Layer | p3lib components | implementation status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Packet format  | `p3lib-sphinx` [1]  | v0.1 |
| Plausible deniability protocol | `p3lib-cfrd` | specs |
| Octopus lookup | `p3lib-multipathlookup`, `p3lib-shadownode` [2] | specs |

If you are interested about implementation details and APIs of p3lib components,
check the [specifications](./specs).

### Privacy design

p3lib provides a set of interfaces that play together nicely and can be used
separately or as a whole. The [interfaces](./specs/interfaces.md) specs show the
current interfaces and abstractions that p3lib exposes and implements.

p3lib is designed to integrate seamlessly with [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p).
